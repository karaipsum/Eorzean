Currently supports:
- Basic Latin alphabets (A-Z, a-z)
- Diacritics latin alphabets (🇫🇷, 🇩🇪 and more!)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Basic punctuations and symbols
- and more (…?)

## Kerning Preview

![Kerning](preview/Kerning.svg)
Manually adjusted kerning pairs for improved readability. Toggle "Metrics" setting in your preferred design software to apply.

## Opentype Features Support (default off)

Below are currently supported Opentype features. They are based on my personal idea and interpretation, which I haven't noticed in official arkworks so far. They are **off** by default. You may turn it on for fun.
### Discretionary Ligature (dlig)
